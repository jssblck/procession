//! The server binary for `procession`: the fault tolerant, performant, language agnostic background job server.
//!
//! # UI
//!
//! The UI is served at the root of the HTTP server.
//!
//! It is responsible for:
//!
//! - Rendering queues and jobs in progress.
//! - Displaying job statistics in a human readable format.
//! - Providing basic queue and job management for human operators.
//!
//! # Job management
//!
//! Due to the call and response nature of job management, all job management is handled on the HTTP server.
//!
//! # Worker APIs
//!
//! Procession supports workers with both a TCP and HTTP API.
//! The intention is that clients wishing to be maximally performant should use the TCP API,
//! while clients that want a simpler way to integrate or in environments that don't support non-HTTP ports
//! can fall back to the HTTP API.
//!
//! For example, it's not uncommon in some corporate environments to have restrictions on the
//! ports services may use to make outbound communication.
//! In such an environment it may be helpful to be able to connect to the job server over HTTP instead,
//! despite the performance overhead this brings.
//!
//! ## HTTP
//!
//! The HTTP worker API is implemented via submitting new jobs as a standard HTTP POST,
//! and receiving job assignments via long-polling a HTTP GET.
//!
//! As with most long polling implementations the server keeps the connection open for a set amount of time,
//! after which the client receives an empty response and is expected to re-initialize the same request.
//!
//! The intent with a long polling fallback is to provide the ability for clients to operate in enviroments
//! that are hostile to plain TCP. Such environments are usually also relatively picky about killing idle HTTP connections,
//! so Procession's long polling implementation generally trades performance in order to operate more nicely with
//! proxies that may be configured with very severe timeouts.
//!
//! For improved performance, switch to the TCP server if possible.
//!
//! ## TCP
//!
//! The TCP worker API is implemented as a plain TCP connection where the client submits jobs by sending a client initiated payload,
//! and receives job assignments as server initiated payloads.
//!
//! The TCP API is used purely for submitting jobs and receiving job assignment.
//!
//! Any job management or statistics gathering that the client wishes to do is performed via the HTTP API;
//! the idea is that this simplifies both the client and server implementations by ensuring that when connected
//! over TCP both ends of the connection are solely concerned with one kind of task.
